# Wenbu MCP

Six tools for BaZi, the I Ching, tarot, Zi Wei and source-based learning. Remote endpoint: **https://wenbu.app/mcp**. Stateless Streamable HTTP, no Wenbu account or API key. Wenbu MCP does not call DeepSeek; the connected host provides interpretation.

## Connect

For hosts that support a remote URL in `mcpServers`:

```json
{ "mcpServers": { "wenbu": { "url": "https://wenbu.app/mcp" } } }
```

Use [mcp.json](mcp.json), or adapt it to your host's remote-MCP format. Installing the Skill does not configure this connection. There is no local stdio process in this configuration.

## A first reproducible call

```sh
curl -fsS https://wenbu.app/mcp \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -H 'Accept: application/json, text/event-stream' \
  --data-binary @integrations/mcp/examples/iching.json
```

The synthetic example supplies six fixed yang lines. Read `result.structuredContent`: the original hexagram is number 1 and the changing-line list is empty. Hosts should follow their normal initialization flow; the stateless server supports independent requests for compatibility.

| ----------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `calculate_bazi`  | Gregorian date, nullable time, IANA timezone, day boundary and optional approximate solar-time correction |
| `cast_iching`     | Six supplied values, bottom to top, or a new three-coin cast                                              |
| `draw_tarot`      | One or three cards without replacement; optional reversals                                                |
| `calculate_ziwei` | Known local civil date/time and the traditional sex calculation parameter                                 |
| `search_library`  | A bounded catalogue of original learning content and curated reference metadata                           |
| `read_library`    | Complete original guide/symbol content or a named section; preserves scope and source links               |

Set `locale` to `zh` or `en`. Defaults to English. Some traditional names remain Chinese. Resources: `wenbu://methodology` and `wenbu://knowledge`.

## Limits and privacy

MCP calculates cultural symbols, not verified predictions. Calculations reach Wenbu's Cloudflare service. No prompts, birth inputs or chart contents enter the event analytics store. Coarse tool-call analytics can be disabled with `X-Wenbu-Analytics: off`. Your host controls its own history and model data practices. Back off on HTTP 429.
